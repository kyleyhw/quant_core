class SimpleMACrossover(BaseStrategy):
    """
    A simple moving average (SMA) crossover strategy.

    Why this exists:
    - To provide a clear, public example of a trading strategy built upon the BaseStrategy.
    - To demonstrate how to inherit from BaseStrategy and implement a custom entry signal.
    - To serve as a baseline for benchmarking against more complex strategies.

    Signal Logic:
    - Entry: A "fast" SMA crossing over a "slow" SMA.
    - Exit: Managed by the parent BaseStrategy (trailing stop-loss and take-profit).
