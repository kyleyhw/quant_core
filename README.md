# Algorithmic Trading Framework (Open-Core)

This project provides a market-agnostic, Python-based algorithmic trading framework. It is designed with an "Open Core" model: the core infrastructure is public and extensible, while specific trading strategies and trained machine learning models can remain private.

## Purpose

The primary goal is to provide a robust, extensible foundation for developing and implementing algorithmic trading strategies. The framework is designed to evolve from traditional technical analysis to advanced Machine Learning models, with a consistent and strong emphasis on risk management, regardless of the underlying market.

While its initial concrete implementation is for Interactive Brokers (IBKR), the framework is fundamentally designed to be extended to any market or broker API.

## Core Architecture: A Market-Agnostic Framework

The system is architected around a powerful abstraction layer that decouples core trading logic from market-specific details. This allows for the development of strategies that are portable, reusable, and independent of any single broker.

The key to this design is the **Market Adapter** pattern. The core framework defines a set of abstract interfaces for handling connections, data, and execution. A concrete implementation of these interfaces, called a Market Adapter, acts as a "plug-in" for a specific market.

**The Interactive Brokers implementation provided in this repository is the first concrete instantiation of this abstract framework.**

## Tech Stack

The framework leverages the following key technologies:

*   **Core Framework:** `pandas`, `numpy`
*   **IBKR Adapter:** `ib_insync`
*   **Backtesting:** `backtesting.py`
*   **Machine Learning:** `xgboost`, `scikit-learn`
*   **Operations:** `python-dotenv`, `requests`

## Getting Started

1.  **Clone the repository and its submodules:**
    ```bash
    git clone --recurse-submodules [repository-url]
    cd ibkr_quant_core
    ```
2.  **Install dependencies in a virtual environment:**
    Install the core framework in editable mode. To include the Interactive Brokers functionality, specify the `[ibkr]` extra.
    ```bash
    pip install -e .[ibkr]
    ```
3.  **Set up environment variables:**
    Create a `.env` file in the root directory for sensitive information (e.g., IBKR TWS/Gateway connection details, notification webhook URLs).
4.  **Connect to IBKR TWS/Gateway:**
    Ensure your Interactive Brokers Trader Workstation (TWS) or IB Gateway is running and configured to accept API connections.
5.  **Run backtests:**
    Utilize the benchmark script to evaluate strategy performance against historical data.
    ```bash
    python run_backtesting/benchmark.py
    ```

## Core Architectural Rules

### 1. Extensibility via Market Adapters
The framework is designed to be extended. New markets can be added by creating a new adapter in `src/market_adapters/` and implementing the classes defined in `src/interfaces.py`. The core logic in strategies should remain unchanged.

### 2. Machine Learning Workflow (Prevention of Skew)
- **Training:** Occurs in the `research/` directory. Trained models are saved to `models/`.
- **Inference:** Occurs within strategies. Models are loaded from `models/`.
- **Feature Consistency:** Both training and inference code **MUST** import feature generation logic (e.g., indicators) from `src/feature_engineering.py`. This is a critical rule to prevent training-serving skew.

### 3. Execution & Safety (The "Fat Finger" Layer)
- **Position Sizing:** Calculated dynamically in `strategies/base_strategy.py`.
- **Hard Limits:** The market-agnostic `src/execution.py` module enforces hard safety limits (e.g., `MAX_SHARES_PER_ORDER`, `MAX_DOLLAR_VALUE_PER_ORDER`) on a generic order dictionary *before* it is passed to a specific market adapter.
- If a strategy generates an order that exceeds these limits, the system **MUST** raise an `Exception` and send a critical notification.

### 4. Notifications
- The system defines a `Notifier` class in `src/notifications.py`.
- **Triggers:**
  - **Critical:** Connection loss, Order Rejection, "Fat Finger" block.
  - **Info:** Trade execution, Daily P&L summary.

## Development Guidelines
- **Type Hinting:** All functions must have Python type hints.
- **Documentation:** Docstrings should focus on **"Why"** a component exists, not just "What" it does.
- **Backtesting:** Assume a realistic **0.005 (0.5%)** for commission and slippage to avoid over-optimistic results.
- **Benchmarking:** Use the **Sharpe Ratio** as the primary metric for comparing strategies, not total return.
