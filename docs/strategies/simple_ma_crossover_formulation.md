# simple moving average crossover strategy: mathematical formulation

the `simplemacrossover` strategy is based on the relationship between two simple moving averages (smas) of different periods: a "fast" sma and a "slow" sma.

## simple moving average (sma)
the simple moving average (sma) for a given period $n$ is calculated as the arithmetic mean of the closing prices over that period.

let $c_t$ be the closing price at time $t$. the sma for period $n$ at time $t$, denoted as $sma(c, n)_t$, is given by:

$$ sma(c, n)_t = \frac{1}{n} \sum_{i=0}^{n-1} c_{t-i} $$

where:
-   $c_t$: the current closing price.
-   $n$: the number of periods over which the average is calculated.

## crossover signals

the trading signals are generated by comparing the fast sma (e.g., $sma(c, 10)$) with the slow sma (e.g., $sma(c, 20)$).

let $sma_{fast}$ be the sma with the shorter period and $sma_{slow}$ be the sma with the longer period.

-   **buy signal (long entry)**:
    a buy signal is generated when the fast sma crosses above the slow sma. this suggests that recent prices are increasing faster than older prices, indicating potential bullish momentum.
    mathematically, a buy signal occurs at time $t$ if:
    $$ sma_{fast, t} > sma_{slow, t} \quad \text{and} \quad sma_{fast, t-1} \le sma_{slow, t-1} $$

-   **sell signal (long exit)**:
    a sell signal (to close a long position) is generated when the fast sma crosses below the slow sma. this suggests that recent prices are decreasing faster than older prices, indicating potential bearish momentum or a reversal.
    mathematically, a sell signal occurs at time $t$ if:
    $$ sma_{fast, t} < sma_{slow, t} \quad \text{and} \quad sma_{fast, t-1} \ge sma_{slow, t-1} $$

the `basestrategy` then manages the position sizing, stop-loss, and take-profit levels once a trade is entered or exited.
