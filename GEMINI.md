# Project: IBKR Open-Core Algorithmic Trading Bot

## Context & Purpose
I am building a Python-based algorithmic trading system for Interactive Brokers (IBKR). The system is designed as an "Open Core" project: the infrastructure is public, but the specific trading strategies and trained models are private/proprietary.

The goal is to evolve from simple technical analysis strategies to Machine Learning (XGBoost) models while maintaining strict risk management and "fat finger" safety checks.

## Tech Stack Requirements
- **Broker API:** `ib_insync` (Use this over the native IB API for Pythonic syntax).
- **Data/Analysis:** `pandas`, `numpy`, `ta-lib` (or `pandas-ta`).
- **Backtesting:** `backtesting` (backtesting.py) for strategy simulation.
- **Machine Learning:** `xgboost`, `scikit-learn`.
- **Ops:** `python-dotenv` (secrets), `requests` (Discord/Telegram notifications).

## Directory Structure & Logic
The project strictly follows this structure. Do not suggest code that violates this hierarchy.

Core Architectural Rules
1. The "Open Core" Git Workflow
Triggers:

Critical: Connection loss, Order Rejection, "Fat Finger" block.

Info: Trade execution, Daily P&L summary.

Development Guidelines
Type Hinting: All functions must have Python type hints.

**Full Set of Reports**: This term refers to the complete output of the backtesting and benchmarking process. It includes:
1.  A detailed backtest report for each individual strategy (both public and private). A "report" includes both the markdown summary file and the HTML interactive plot.
2.  A public benchmark report, comparing all public strategies.
3.  An "all" benchmark report, comparing all public and private strategies.
Each report is to be generated in its appropriate directory (`/strategies/reports` for public, and `/strategies_private/reports` for private and "all" benchmark reports) to ensure no private information is publicly visible.
